# QBot
QBot is a Discord bot that makes use of the Riot Games API for self-hosting a private League of Legends matchmaking system in a Discord server!

The bot is currently in alpha stages of development and therefore any builds not downloaded off of the release page will most likely contain buggy/broken code and unfinished or unimplemented features.

### Getting Started

Download a build off of the releases page or by cloning the repository and [follow the instructions on the project wiki](https://github.com/ElijahKSmith/QBot/wiki/Getting-Started) to get started!
